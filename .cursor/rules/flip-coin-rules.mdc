## 1. General Enforcement Principles

Cursor must always:

* Apply these rules before generating or modifying code.
* Stop generation if a rule may be violated.
* Explain the violation: rule, reason, location.
* Present interactive buttons:

  [Continue (Single-Time Exception)]
  [Cancel Operation]

Only when the user explicitly clicks **Continue** may Cursor proceed.
Exceptions do not modify the constitution.

## 2. Architectural Rules (Global)

Cursor Must:

* Maintain strict separation of concerns across frontend and backend.
* Use modular code; avoid monolithic files (> 400 lines).
* Ensure all new features align with service-based backend and modular frontend.

Cursor Must Not:

* Introduce tightly coupled logic across layers.
* Mix UI logic with business logic.
* Create large files without splitting them into modules.

## 3. Frontend Rules (Always Enforced)

Cursor Must:

* Use a unified API module (e.g., api.js).
* Implement all requests through api.get/api.post/api.request.
* Keep UI operations inside UI modules/components.
* Centralize state (state.js or designated store).
* Keep components < 300 lines unless explicitly approved.
* Use spacing tokens (space-1 to space-6), radius tokens (4/8/12px).
* Use design tokens for colors; avoid raw hex values.

Cursor Must Not:

* Use bare fetch().
* Mix DOM operations with business logic.
* Duplicate logic across multiple files.
* Introduce new spacing values or arbitrary px sizes.
* Redesign H5 layouts; only scale down Web layout (structural consistency rule).

## 4. Backend Rules (Always Enforced)

Cursor Must:

* Place DB logic in services or repositories only.
* Keep routing thin: validate → call service → format response.
* Use standardized API responses:

  success format:
  { "success": true, "data": … }

  error format (via sendError):
  { "success": false, "error": "message" }

Cursor Must Not:

* Write SQL or ORM queries inside routes.
* Allow services to access req/res.
* Expose raw error messages or stack traces.
* Modify user balances without validator + service checks.

## 5. Security Rules

Cursor Must:

* Validate all money-related operations.
* Sanitize all external-facing error messages.
* Mask blockchain addresses when displaying them.
* Apply IP whitelist logic for admin areas when relevant.

Cursor Must Not:

* Output sensitive data, internal DB structure, or raw chain errors.

## 6. UI Density and Structural Rules (Critical)

Cursor Must:

* Enforce high-density casino-grade UI.
* Maintain structural parity between Web and H5 (H5 = scaled version, not redesigned).
* Apply component density guidelines:

  * Web GameCard height: ~180–210px
  * H5 GameCard = ~60–70% Web size
  * Quick Entry Card: Web 88–110px; H5 68–82px

Cursor Must Not:

* Modify fundamental layout patterns for H5.
* Introduce excessive white space.
* Break spacing rhythm.

## 7. RWD Scaling Rules

Cursor Must:

* Use breakpoint logic:
  desktop >= 1280
  tablet 768–1279
  mobile <= 767
* Ensure H5 uses proportional scaling:
  spacing 70–80%
  icons 80–90%
  cards 60–70%
  modals 70%

## 8. Naming & File Rules

Cursor Must:

* Use camelCase for variables/functions.
* Use PascalCase for classes/components.
* Ensure file names match import paths exactly (case-sensitive).

Cursor Must Not:

* Introduce version comments inside the code (e.g., // v1.2).
* Use inconsistent file naming styles.

## 9. Versioning & Documentation Rules

Cursor Must:

* Place all change history in CHANGELOG.md.
  Cursor Must Not:
* Add version markers inside source files.

## 10. Automatic Violation Detection (Mandatory)

Before generating code, Cursor must check:

* Layering violations (route writing SQL, service using req/res)
* Design system violations (raw px, raw color)
* UI density violations
* RWD structure violations
* Security violations (money, addresses, admin area)
* Performance violations (monolithic file creation)

If any violation detected:
→ Stop generation
→ Provide violation summary
→ Display:

```
[Continue (Single-Time Exception)]
[Cancel Operation]
```

This is mandatory and cannot be disabled.
